<div>I have just created four cloned Redhat partitions on my laptop.  I did a base 20GB install of:

<br><br>rhel-server-7.2-x86_64-dvd.iso
<br>
I then created the full clones via vmware fusion and named them red,green,blue,and orange.
<br>
This configuration is in line with the ansible request that we start with a blank slate and build everything through the tool.  However, there are some things that I will surely need:

ssh set up to run between servers as a special user that can elevate to root.
Python.
